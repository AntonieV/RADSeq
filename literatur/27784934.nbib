AB  - In the present century sequencing is to the DNA science, what gel electrophoresis 
      was to it in the last century. From 1977 to 2016 three generation of the sequencing 
      technologies of various types have been developed. Second and third generation 
      sequencing technologies referred commonly to as next generation sequencing 
      technology, has evolved significantly with increase in sequencing speed, decrease in 
      sequencing cost, since its inception in 2004. GS FLX by 454 Life Sciences/Roche 
      diagnostics, Genome Analyzer, HiSeq, MiSeq and NextSeq by Illumina, Inc., SOLiD by 
      ABI, Ion Torrent by Life Technologies are various type of the sequencing platforms 
      available for second generation sequencing. The platforms available for the third 
      generation sequencing are Helicosâ„¢ Genetic Analysis System by SeqLL, LLC, SMRT 
      Sequencing by Pacific Biosciences, Nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore's, 
      Complete Genomics by Beijing Genomics Institute and GnuBIO by BioRad, to name few. 
      The present article is an overview of the principle and the sequencing chemistry of 
      these high throughput sequencing technologies along with brief comparison of various 
      types of sequencing platforms available.
