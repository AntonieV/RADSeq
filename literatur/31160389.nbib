AB  - The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) underlies almost all of modern molecular 
      cloning. Using PCR, a defined target sequence that occurs once within a DNA of high 
      complexity and large size-an entire mammalian genome, for example-can be rapidly and 
      selectively amplified in a quasi-exponential chain reaction that generates millions 
      of copies. The reaction is simple to set up, cheap, and undemanding, the only 
      requirement being some knowledge of the nucleotide sequences of the target. In 
      addition to its simplicity, PCR is robust, speedy, flexible, and sensitive.
