AB  - Demand for fast, inexpensive, and accurate DNA sequencing data has led to the birth 
      and dominance of a new generation of sequencing technologies. So-called 
      "next-generation" sequencing technologies enable rapid generation of data by 
      sequencing massive amounts of DNA in parallel using diverse methodologies which 
      overcome the limitations of Sanger sequencing methods used to sequence the first 
      human genome. Despite opening new frontiers of genomics research, the fundamental 
      shift away from the Sanger sequencing that next-generation technologies has created 
      has also left many unaware of the capabilities and applications of these new 
      technologies, especially those in the clinical realm. Moreover, the brisk evolution 
      of sequencing technologies has flooded the market with commercially available 
      sequencing platforms, whose unique chemistries and diverse applications stand as 
      another obstacle restricting the potential of next-generation sequencing. This 
      review serves to provide a primer on next-generation sequencing technologies for 
      clinical researchers and physician scientists. We provide an overview of the 
      capabilities and clinical applications of DNA sequencing technologies to raise 
      awareness among researchers about the power of these novel genomic tools. In 
      addition, we discuss that key sequencing principles provide a comparison between 
      existing and near-term technologies and outline key advantages and disadvantages 
      between different sequencing platforms to help researchers choose an appropriate 
      platform for their research interests.
