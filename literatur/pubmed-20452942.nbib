AB  - The discovery of the DNA double helix structure half a century ago immediately 
      suggested a mechanism for its duplication by semi-conservative copying of the 
      nucleotide sequence into two DNA daughter strands. Shortly after, a second 
      fundamental step toward the elucidation of the mechanism of DNA replication was 
      taken with the isolation of the first enzyme able to polymerize DNA from a template. 
      In the subsequent years, the basic mechanism of DNA replication and its enzymatic 
      machinery components were elucidated, mostly through genetic approaches and in vitro 
      biochemistry. Most recently, the spatial and temporal organization of the DNA 
      replication process in vivo within the context of chromatin and inside the intact 
      cell are finally beginning to be elucidated. On the one hand, recent advances in 
      genome-wide high throughput techniques are providing a new wave of information on 
      the progression of genome replication at high spatial resolution. On the other hand, 
      novel super-resolution microscopy techniques are just starting to give us the first 
      glimpses of how DNA replication is organized within the context of single intact 
      cells with high spatial resolution. The integration of these data with time lapse 
      microscopy analysis will give us the ability to film and dissect the replication of 
      the genome in situ and in real time.
