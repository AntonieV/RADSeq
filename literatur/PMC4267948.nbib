AB  - Accurate phylogenies are critical to taxonomy as well as studies of speciation 
      processes and other evolutionary patterns. Accurate branch lengths in phylogenies 
      are critical for dating and rate measurements. Such accuracy may be jeopardized by 
      unacknowledged sequencing error. We use simulated data to test a correction for DNA 
      sequencing error in maximum likelihood phylogeny inference. Over a wide range of 
      data polymorphism and true error rate, we found that correcting for sequencing error 
      improves recovery of the branch lengths, even if the assumed error rate is up to 
      twice the true error rate. Low error rates have little effect on recovery of the 
      topology. When error is high, correction improves topological inference; however, 
      when error is extremely high, using an assumed error rate greater than the true 
      error rate leads to poor recovery of both topology and branch lengths. The error 
      correction approach tested here was proposed in 2004 but has not been widely used, 
      perhaps because researchers do not want to commit to an estimate of the error rate. 
      This study shows that correction with an approximate error rate is generally 
      preferable to ignoring the issue.
