AB  - High-throughput sequencing makes it possible to evaluate thousands of genetic 
      markers across genomes and populations. Reduced-representation sequencing 
      approaches, like double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing 
      (ddRADseq), are frequently applied to screen for genetic variation. In particular in 
      nonmodel organisms where whole-genome sequencing is not yet feasible, ddRADseq has 
      become popular as it allows genomewide assessment of variation patterns even in the 
      absence of other genomic resources. However, while many tools are available for the 
      analysis of ddRADseq data, few options exist to simulate ddRADseq data in order to 
      evaluate the accuracy of downstream tools. The available tools either focus on the 
      optimization of ddRAD experiment design or do not provide the information necessary 
      for a detailed evaluation of different ddRAD analysis tools. For this task, a ground 
      truth, that is, the underlying information of all effects in the data set, is 
      required. Therefore, we here present ddrage, the ddRAD Data Set Generator, that 
      allows both developers and users to evaluate their ddRAD analysis software. ddrage 
      allows the user to adjust many parameters such as coverage and rates of mutations, 
      sequencing errors or allelic dropouts, in order to generate a realistic simulated 
      ddRADseq data set for given experimental scenarios and organisms. The simulated 
      reads can be easily processed with available analysis software such as stacks or 
      pyrad and evaluated against the underlying parameters used to generate the data to 
      gauge the impact of different parameter values used during downstream data 
      processing.
