AB  - Sequence alignment is an active research area in the field of bioinformatics. It is 
      also a crucial task as it guides many other tasks like phylogenetic analysis, 
      function, and/or structure prediction of biological macromolecules like DNA, RNA, 
      and Protein. Proteins are the building blocks of every living organism. Although 
      protein alignment problem has been studied for several decades, unfortunately, every 
      available method produces alignment results differently for a single alignment 
      problem. Multiple sequence alignment is characterized as a very high computational 
      complex problem. Many stochastic methods, therefore, are considered for improving 
      the accuracy of alignment. Among them, many researchers frequently use Genetic 
      Algorithm. In this study, we have shown different types of the method applied in 
      alignment and the recent trends in the multiobjective genetic algorithm for solving 
      multiple sequence alignment. Many recent studies have demonstrated considerable 
      progress in finding the alignment accuracy.
